I'm Cat, a none-of-your-business year old, learning to code ~~horribly~~.  I absolutely ***adore*** felines and reading, especially Warrior Cats. Also, cringe culture is dead, so do what you want. My favorite colors are green (specifically more darker, teal greens ex. `#09874c`) and pink (specifically lighter, redder pinks like `#ff6eb1`).
